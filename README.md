# React Blank Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and then modified to create stateful functional components as explained by this [blog post](https://medium.com/@baronmaximilianwilleford/react-without-this-39a76b8f2160) as a way to create a more unified syntax between functional components and class components for first-time learners of React.

To run this application, clone it down into your workspace, and then run the following two commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
